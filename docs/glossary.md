# Glossary (plain language)

- **BAM**: A binary file containing aligned sequencing reads.
- **VCF**: A text file listing genetic variants.
- **Index**: A small companion file (like `.bai` or `.tbi`) that lets tools quickly jump to regions.
- **AF (allele fraction)**: Fraction of reads supporting the variant allele at a site.
- **DP (depth)**: Total read depth at a position.
- **baseQ**: Per‑base confidence score from the sequencer.
- **mapQ**: Confidence that a read is correctly aligned.
- **Anchor**: A somatic SNV used as evidence to assign reads to tumor or non‑tumor.
- **Posterior**: Probability from the model that a read is tumor‑derived.
